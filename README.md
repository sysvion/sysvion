I'm new to the foss culture. And i'm trying to setup a custom site where i put my interest. And i'm going to blog there. ([Github](https://github.com/sysvion/sysvion.nl).)

I'm also responsible for a [website](https://www.delftschezwervers.nl) of a student association. Where members can:
- sign up for meals.
- Show what we are going to do.
- Upload foto's to a photoalbum.
- And more!

I'm mostly doing UX. And development of our backend technologies.

With a mathematics student, we're trying to add an encrypted chat function to the student association website. With everything homemade! But giving to option for default encrypting for the ones wo don't trust the implementation.
