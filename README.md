I'm new to the foss culture. And i'm trying to setup a custom site where i put my intrest. And i'm going to blog there. ([Github](https://github.com/sysvion/sysvion.nl).)

I'm also responsable of a [website](https://www.delftschezwervers.nl) of an student association. Where members can sign up for meals. Upload foto's to an photoalbum. 

With a mathematics student were trying to add an encrypted chat funtion to the website . With everything homemade! But giving to option for default encrypting for the ones wo don't trust the implementation.
