I'm very new in the foss culture. And i'm trying to setup a custom [site](https://github.com/sysvion/sysvion.nl) where i put my intrest. And i'm going to blog there. I'm also responsable of the Membership Management [website](https://www.delftschezwervers.nl) of an student association. Where members can sign up for meals. And with a mathematics were trying to create an encrypted chat funtion. With everything homemade! But giving default encrypting for the ones wo don't trust us.
